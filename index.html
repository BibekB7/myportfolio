        <h2>Welcome To My <br />Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
          I am a 19 year old guy from a beautiful country called Nepal. I am
          currently staying in Kathmandu Nepal for my Bachelor level education and
          studying Computer Programming Language on CSE. I am a self tought programmer who
          spent half of time doing mistakes only and thats why I feel that it
          helped me to groom myself out. If you want to be related with me then
          stay tuned with me for some awesome blogs.

        Playing with computers was my biggest passion since my childhood. I
        started my journey when I was in class 11.As a self taught
        programmer,<br />I had to face a lot of difficulties:for most of the
        times I had been doing stuffs which were worthless or they don't
        increase your skillset enough to get mentally prepared for the real
        world suffs. Yeah you,yes you the person right in front of the
        screen,<br />I know you have been also suffering from these anxieties
        that I had faced but that's how everything works especially while doing
        things on your own but believe me this will definitely grow you as a
        person. From now I'll be sharing my tech journey and a lot of stuffs
        related to technology,<br />programming and other more related stuffs
        through blogs in this website and will also be doing some cool stuffs in
        the coming days. Stay Safe !! Stay Tuned
